## Tasks

* 0. Lockboxes

### 0\. Pascal's Triangle

You have n number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1 and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.

Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.

*   Prototype: def canUnlockAll(boxes)
*   boxes is a list of lists
*   A key with the same number as a box opens that box
*   You can assume all keys will be positive integers
*   * There can be keys that do not have boxes
*   The first box boxes[0] is unlocked
*   Return True if all boxes can be opened, else return False
